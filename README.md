Hi, I'm Romain Beaumont aka rom1504. I like computer science and programming a lot.
My long term objective is to create artificially intelligent software.

I'm currently working as a machine learning engineer, building representation learning software for recommender systems.

On my free time, I have two main activities related to computer science:
* exploring machine learning and writing blogpost about it
* maintaining and leading the PrismarineJS community to build packages for minecraft in javascript

Blog posts I written and projects I'm working on are listed below.
